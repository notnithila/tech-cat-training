## 3.4.1 Activity



**Scenario**

Imagine that NorthWind Traders has two distinct marketing teams. One team focuses on the "AUTOMOBILE" market segment while the other focuses on the "BUILDING" market segment. You are asked to provide a list of all customers from both of these market segments without any duplicates. Since customers can belong to multiple market segments over time, using `UNION` will ensure that each customer appears only once in the result.
