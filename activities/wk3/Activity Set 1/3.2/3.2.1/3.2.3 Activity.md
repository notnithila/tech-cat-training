Add a column named `order_status` to the following query that will use a `case`expression to return the value `'order now'` if the `ps_availqty` value is less than `100`, `'order soon'` if the `ps_availqty` value is between `101` and `1000`, and `'plenty in stock'` otherwise:

```sql
select ps_partkey, ps_suppkey, ps_availqty
from partsupp
where ps_partkey between 148300 and 148450;
```
