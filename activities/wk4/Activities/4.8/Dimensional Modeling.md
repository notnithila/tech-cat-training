# Designing a Star Schema Data Warehouse for a Retail Store

### Instructions:

#### 1. Understand the Business Requirements

**Retail Store's Business Model**

**Products:**

- The retail store sells various products across different categories such as electronics, clothing, groceries, and household items.
- Each product has attributes like product ID, name, category, brand, price, and stock quantity.
- Products are organized into categories and subcategories to help in inventory management and sales analysis.

**Sales:**

- Sales transactions capture the details of purchases made by customers.
- Each transaction includes attributes such as sale ID, product ID, customer ID, store ID, time of sale, quantity sold, and total sales amount.
- Sales data is crucial for understanding revenue, profit margins, and sales trends over time.

**Customers:**

- Customers are the individuals who purchase products from the retail store.
- Customer attributes include customer ID, name, address, region, age group, and preferred shopping channel (online or in-store).
- Understanding customer demographics and purchasing behavior helps in targeted marketing and improving customer satisfaction.

**Time Dimensions:**

- Time is a critical dimension for analyzing trends and patterns.
- The time dimension includes attributes like date, day of the week, month, quarter, and year.
- Time-related analyses help in understanding seasonal trends, peak shopping periods, and the impact of promotions and holidays on sales.



#### 2. Identify the Fact and Dimension Tables

- **Fact Table:**
  - Discuss and list out the key business processes that generate data (e.g., sales transactions).
  - Identify the measures and metrics for the fact table (e.g., sales amount, quantity sold).
- **Dimension Tables:**
  - Identify and list the different dimensions needed to analyze the data (e.g., Product, Customer, Store, Time).

#### 3. Design the Star Schema

- Schema Diagram:
  - Create a diagram of the star schema showing the central fact table and its relationships with surrounding dimension tables.
  - Ensure the fact table connects to each dimension table via foreign keys.

#### 4. Define the Tables

- **Fact Table Definition:**
  - Define the structure of the fact table including columns, data types, and primary/foreign keys.

* **Dimension Table Definitions:**
  - Define the structure of each dimension table including columns, data types, and primary keys.
